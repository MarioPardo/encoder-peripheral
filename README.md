<h1> Encoder Peripheral </h1>

I wanted to gain hands on end to end embedded experience. 
So I am taking an encoder and implementing it from RTL, through an FPGA, all the way to being able to read it from embedded linux. 

The goal is to touch as many aspects of embedded as possible, to understand the whole "stack".
